#  Headphones Landing Page

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Foundations** curriculum.  
The goal is to build a fully responsive landing page for a fictional headphones company, based on a **Figma design file** provided.

---

##  Project Overview
The webpage is built using **HTML5** and **CSS3** only (no external libraries or frameworks).  
It replicates the design provided in the Figma file while ensuring responsiveness and interactivity.

Key features:
- Responsive layout that switches to a **mobile version** when the screen width ≤ 480px.
- Centered content with a maximum width of **1000px**.
- Hover/active states:
  - Links → `#FF6565`
  - Buttons → `opacity: 0.9`
- Uses custom fonts:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - Spin Cycle OT (provided in assets if missing)

---

##  Design (Figma)
- Figma project was duplicated into drafts for easy access.  
- All design details (fonts, sizes, spacing) are respected.  
- Some values in Figma are floats; rounded values were used where appropriate.
